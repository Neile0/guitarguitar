Yes, Gretsch have whapped a big ol’ Fideli’Tron electric guitar pickup onto the face of this Rancher acoustic! We were very intrigued to say the least when this guitar was first delivered!</p>\r\n<p>So, before we get ahead of ourselves, let us check out what we have here. The G5031FT is a Dreadnought with a solid Spruce top and a host of nice Gretsch details like thumbnail inlays, gold hardware, a ton of binding and a most distinctive triangular soundhole! The Sunburst finish is gorgeous too, a great contrast with the Gold hardware.</p>\r\n<p>The fit and finish is excellent: quality control is obviously high and this guitar plays very agreeably. Sonically, the Spruce top and laminated Mahogany work with the dreadnought shape and scalloped X-bracing to create a strong tone with a bright top and a good note fundamentals. Strumming is excellent and fingerpicking sounds extremely pleasant.</p>\r\n<p>So what of this pickup? Well, this Fideli’Tron pickup has been seen on electric guitars like the Fender Cabronita already but it was in fact developed for this range of Gretsch acoustics. It has a clear, low output and is nestled in a wooden box (‘isolation chamber’) to sort out feedback problems. And yes, it does sound like a mix between an electric and an acoustic! Its definitely not supposed to give you sumptuous life-like acoustic tones: it’s meant to give a large, slightly darker voice that suits supportive rhythmic playing and effects-laden soundscaping over straight up lead soloing. It works well and if you want a more lo-fi, scuzzy sound then this will reveal itself to be very useful (and fun) for you!</p>\r\n<p>It’s a unique guitar and no mistake: only Gretsch could do something like this! It is a success though for sure, as long as you what to expect! We love it. More of this!</p>","productDetail":"Gretsch Rancher acoustics are back and better than ever for 2014.

With a feel that seems pre-played in and a fantastic new Zero Impact pickup and preamp system, the Yamaha L Series are a serious proposition indeed.</p>\r\n<p>This model is a Transacoustic guitar. This proprietary technology developed by Yamaha simulates, via an ‘actuator’ attached within the guitar to the back of the body, the natural reverb and chorus effects that occur when you play in an acoustically superb room. The idea is that the guitar just sounds much better in a natural way. This unit, powered by batteries, has a couple of controls to determine how much reverb and chorus you want in your sound. In practice, this sounds very convincing when set properly: there is an extra dimension to the sounds that really open up the sound and enliven your playing. It’s very unusual but in a great way!</p>\r\n<p>The guitar itself is very impressive, too: top quality Engelmann Spruce for the top and solid Rosewood for the back and sides makes for a classic combination that sounds fantastic. The top has been treated to Yamaha's A.R.E. process which simulates the sound of aged and played -in wood. The timber sounds more mature and enhances the overall playing experience further. An Ebony fingerboard brings extra class to proceedings.</p>\r\n<p>The Dreadnought body shape is a traditionally classic and sonically versatile choice: strumming and fingerpicking work equally well, especially with the Transacoustic technology in effect!

The pint-size Dreadnought was originally inspired by a desire to provide a smaller, starter-size guitar for kids and a legitimate musical companion for travelers, but players have since adapted it for their needs in all sorts of creative ways, from high-stringing it to setting it up to play lap slide, to embracing alternate tunings that add unique acoustic flavors to recordings. This model also comes equipped with the Expression System Baby™ (ES-B) pickup, which incorporates piezo design elements from the Taylor ES2. The pickup is powered by an onboard preamp with a built-in digital chromatic tuner. The preamp/tuner unit features an LED display for tuning and low battery indication, along with Tone and Volume controls.","salesPrice":439.0,"pictureMain":"https://images.guitarguitar.co.uk/cdn/large/150/190718346268008f.jpg","qtyInStock":4,"qtyOnOrder":-1,"colour":7,"pickup":1,"bodyShape":7,"createdOn":"2019-07-23T13:02:23.97","imageUrls":null},{"skU_ID":"190618345096008","asn":"887766099413","category":"GUAG_1","online":true,"itemName":"114e Grand Auditorium","title":"","brandName":"Taylor","description":"<h2>At A Glance:</h2>\r\n<p>The Taylor 114e is a versatile, and large sounding guitar.

The longer neck allows the use \r\nof heavier gauge strings which in turn means you can tune each string much lower \r\nthan usual, yet maintain the correct, playable string tension.</p>\r\n<p>So, you can still tune your Baritone in standard tuning and play the same \r\nchord shapes you’re used to, yet achieve a much lower sound. Common standard \r\nBaritone tunings include A D G C E A (a 5th lower) or a B E A D F&#9839; B (a \r\n4th lower).</p>\r\n<p>Where are Baritone guitars used?</p>\r\n<p>A staple of a wide range of musical styles from jazz, hard rock, surf, and \r\neven fingerstyle acoustic music. The darker, slightly more ominous tone works \r\nperfectly for certain types of music and is nigh-on impossible to achieve on a \r\nstandard acoustic guitar that typically operates in the higher tuning registers \r\nthat therefore deliver a brighter sound.</p>\r\n<p>A good Baritone should sound low enough in the mix to stand out from a \r\nstandard acoustic yet still sit high enough to cut through above the bass. Our \r\nHiGloss Baritone features an all-over high-gloss finish that is particularly \r\neffective in aiding the natural resonance of the Neptune body shape while \r\nensuring a fantastic level of clarity, string articulation and volume is \r\nachieved.</p>\r\n<p>Faith HiGloss series have always been designed to offer both visual and aural \r\nbeauty, and with the updating to HiGloss-3, we’re sure you’ll agree these \r\nwonderful instruments will continue to inspire musicians for generations to \r\ncome.</p>\r\n<p>Using a more sustainable 3-piece, solid rosewood back design, we can ensure \r\nthat these incredibly popular models are available longer-term and yet retain \r\nall the tonal and visual punch that HiGloss-series aficionados have come to \r\nexpect. Using high grade Engelmann Spruce for the top and highly-figured, \r\n3-piece Rosewood bound in Flamed Maple for the back and sides, HiGloss-3 models \r\nalso feature solid Flamed Maple binding on the front and use stripy Indonesian \r\nEbony for the fingerboard, bridge, headplate and heelcap.</p>\r\n<p>Tonally, this combination of wood is generally bright and ‘zingy’, delivering \r\ngreat clarity. Visualising this as a frequency curve, it would be shaped like a \r\nsmile: high on the bass, dipping down through the middle and rising once again \r\nat the top end. Therefore greater string separation and articulation is \r\nachieved, lending itself to fingerstyle and solo pieces in particular.</p>\r\n","salesPrice":999.0,"pictureMain":"https://images.guitarguitar.co.uk/cdn/large/170/210920374283025f.jpg","qtyInStock":1,"qtyOnOrder":0,"colour":7,"pickup":1,"bodyShape":11,"createdOn":"2021-09-28T14:09:32.44","imageUrls":null},{"skU_ID":"211006375000025","asn":"885978896226","category":"GUAG_1","online":true,"itemName":"FSR Malibu Player Shell Pink Walnut Fingerboard","title":"","brandName":"Fender","description":"<h2>At A Glance: </h2>\r\n<p>Fender, that most Californian of guitar brands, brings us a fresh new series \r\nof acoustic guitars that celebrates the Sunshine State.

Cole Clark guitars are designed to be the best sounding acoustic guitars when plugged in. With their proprietary pickup system, you can certainly hear how much time and expertise has gone into the design and sound of these instruments. Plugged in the guitars sound incredibly natural as if listening to a mic'd up acoustic itself. Combined with sustainable Australian timbers and unique construction features, these guitars are one of a kind.   </p>\r\n<h2>Features We Love:</h2>\r\n<h3>Sustainable Australian timber</h3>\r\n<p>Across the Cole Clark line you'll find all the wood used is not only sustainable but comes directly from Australia, cutting down on their climate impact. In addition to this, we're given access to tonewoods you don't usually find on acoustic guitars. The Queensland pale used on this guitar is unlike US maple, and has a neutral tone similar to South American mahogany but with more snap. Combined with the Bunya timber this guitar excels at percussive harder styles as the maple adds a fast attack. </p>\r\n<h3>Cole Clark Pickup System</h3>\r\n<p>The pickup system in these guitars is second to none. Developed to help you sound as natural as possible when plugged in and eliminate problem frequencies and tonalities that can so often plague electro-acoustic guitars. Starting with 6 piezo elements under the bridge which focus on the low-end frequencies, then a face sensor that covers your mid to high end starting at 350Hz. Finally, a condenser microphone covers the high end above 2.5kHz. Combined and fully customizable with the blend controls this <strong>creates an incredibly natural sound</strong>, that picks up everything even the sound of your hand against the neck. </p>\r\n<h3>Unique Construction</h3>\r\n<p>Once the pickup system was made Cole Clark designed the guitar around it. This has led to some unique construction methods, again in an effort to create the best performance acoustic guitars on the market. Notably, the guitar features a Spanish style heel construction. This means the neck is made, and then the body top is joined followed by the back and sides. Altogether meaning the neck is 1 piece all the way to the soundhole, <strong>creating an incredibly resonant instrument</strong>.  </p>\r\n<h2>Highlights:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Sustainable Australian timber</li>\r\n<li>Very natural sounding pickup</li>\r\n<li>Unique construction method</li>\r\n<li>Top quality hardware</li>\r\n</ul>","productDetail":"","salesPrice":999.0,"pictureMain":"https://images.guitarguitar.co.uk/cdn/large/170/211020375705025f.jpg","qtyInStock":2,"qtyOnOrder":0,"colour":7,"pickup":1,"bodyShape":10,"createdOn":"2021-10-27T11:39:36.58","imageUrls":null},{"skU_ID":"190724346616008","asn":"812309028223","category":"GUAG_1","online":true,"itemName":"Artist Series ABT60CE-8BK 8 String Electro Acoustic Baritone Black","title":"","brandName":"Alvarez","description":"<h2>At A Glance: </h2>\r\n<p>There's not a lot of guitars out there like the Alvarez Artist Series \r\nABT60CE-8BK 8 String Baritone.

By using the most advanced components like locking tuners, an Evertune bridge and custom Seymour Duncan pickups, Solar have created a fantastic looking and ergonomic guitar that's built to sound great and keep sounding great, no matter how hard you play. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This 7 string model is finished in a striking Lime Burst Matte finish that allows you to see the \r\ngorgeous grain of the flamed maple veneer under the paint and is accented by black hardware. It's a tasteful take on the extreme guitar and would suit those looking to play aggressive music at high speeds!</p>\r\n<h2>Features We Love:</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Type A Series</h3>\r\n<p>Solar Guitar founder and YouTube celebrity Ola Englund designed the Type A Series of guitars with gigging artists in mind. Combining decades of touring experience, he set out with the vision to create the most reliable and fluid feeling instrument possible for use on the road. With impenetrable tuning stability thanks to the locking tuners and Evertune bridge, an ergonomic one volume. \r\none tone and 5-way pickup selector configuration, Luminlay side dots, 24 super jumbo frets and the awesome sounding high output Duncan Solar pickups, if the quest was to create the ultimate gigging machine for metal, we'd say that the mission's been accomplished!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Evertune Bridge</h3>\r\n<p>The Evertune bridge has been a true breakthrough in the guitar world over the last few years, especially loved by metal players where aggressive precise playing is met with running and jumping around on stage. Many factors can interfere with your guitar's tuning, from humidity and temperature, to playing style and even how new your strings are. Evertune bridges use a patented mechanical system which remembers the string tension after you tune your guitar, once it's set and the system is activated the guitar will never go out of tune. Changes in climate, strings stretching or general aggressive playing are all corrected by the bridge, leaving the guitar in tune in any situation. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Duncan Solar</h3>\r\n<p>Englund collaborated with Seymour Duncan to develop a pickup specifically for Solar Guitars. The Duncan Solar pickups are exclusive to Solar Guitars and compliment the guitar's alder body perfectly to create a tone with a tight low end and clear highs. Of course, they sound amazing overdriven, but Ola knew it was important for them to clean up nicely and the result is a pickup set that's versatile over a wide range of dynamics. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Highlights:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The ultimate metal guitar!</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Evertune bridge and locking tuners offer impervious tuning stability</li>\r\n<li>7 string model makes extreme low tunings possible without compromise</li>\r\n\t<li>Stunning Lime Burst finish atop the Flamed Maple Veneer</li>\r\n</ul>","productDetail":"<p>This Type AB1.7 seven-string bolt-on guitar boasts stealth looks, a \r\ndistinctive cutaway scoop and a remarkable feature set, making it the ultimate, \r\nprecise and professional instrument suitable for both stage and studio work. </p>\r\n<p>This guitar features the Evertune® constant-tension bridge—a reliable, \r\nfully-mechanical system that keeps the guitar in tune under any circumstances. \r\nIt also features Duncan Solar pickups that provide a full spectrum of tonal \r\noptions, from organic clean to heavily overdriven, all with fluid sustain and \r\nmaximum clarity.</p>\r\n<p>The Type AB1.7 features a bolt-on neck joint design with 25.5” scale, an \r\nalder body, a fast, thin, comfortable roasted maple neck, an ebony fingerboard with 24 super-jumbo stainless steel frets, Luminlay ‘glow in the \r\ndark’ side dots for easy stage use.

Gagon found his inspiration reviewing original \r\nprints stored in Leo’s private laboratory at G&L, but that was just the start. \r\nIn the early ’80s, Gagon was an R&D engineer at another company when he was \r\ntasked with finding out what was so special about the early bolt-on guitars many \r\nplayers raved about. Gagon analyzed many examples of what were considered holy \r\ngrail guitars, spending time out on the shop floor talking to builders still \r\nworking in the pickup department since the ‘50s, all on a quest to discover \r\nwhere the real mojo was – and wasn’t. What he learned from the builders matched \r\nhis own engineering analysis. You see, back in the day, the actual spec of \r\npickups coming down that old production line varied considerably. That meant \r\ncoming up with the right specs for the Legacy pickups was more challenging than \r\nsimply following the prints. Gagon’s persistence paid off as the Legacy garnered \r\nrave reviews from both players and magazines like Guitar Player and Guitar \r\nWorld.</p>\r\n<p>This axe is no slave to the past, however, starting with Leo’s PTB™ (Passive \r\nTreble and Bass) system which functions on all three pickups for dramatically \r\nmore variety than the vintage setup. What’s more, the Legacy features a Leo \r\nFender-designed Dual-Fulcrum vibrato, a work of engineering art which allows \r\nbending up or down with unsurpassed stability, while offering a silky feel \r\nthrough its beefy aluminum vibrato arm.</p>\r\n<p>The Legacy is all about honest, classic Alnico tone complemented by Leo’s own \r\nmodern refinements. And now, it’s available at a price within reach of every \r\nworking musician. Once you play a G&L Tribute Series, you’ll never look back.</p>\r\n\r\n","salesPrice":299.0,"pictureMain":"https://images.guitarguitar.co.uk/cdn/large/170/210305367316025-8762550f.jpg","qtyInStock":1,"qtyOnOrder":0,"colour":5,"pickup":3,"bodyShape":1,"createdOn":"2022-10-05T17:11:00.14","imageUrls":null},{"skU_ID":"210319367721025-8697061","asn":" 885978742042 ","category":"GUEG_1","online":true,"itemName":"Player Plus Nashville Tele 3 Tone Sunburst Maple Fingerboard (Ex-Demo) #MX21115313","title":"","brandName":"Fender","description":"<h2>At A Glance: </h2>\r\n<p>The Fender Player Plus Nashville Telecaster 3 Tone Sunburst Maple Fingerboard improves upon the already classic variation.
